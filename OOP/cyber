Cryptography : sience aims to secure protocols
Primatives : Unit to Form Cryptography Protocol [SymEnc - AsymEnc - DS - KEX ] 
Cryptography Algorethim : Application On the Primative by using it in small and Specefic Functionality
Cryptography Protocol : Group of Primatives formed a Full Protocol




First Classification : (Sym vs Asym)
Second Classification : (Math Based [Arethmatic Ops or Logic Ops or Functions] vs Heuristic Based )
Third Classification : (Theoretical [Still Ideas not performed] Vs Applied [Created and standaralized Algorethims])



1.	Block Cipher Converts the plain text into cipher text by taking plain textâ€™s block at a time.	Stream Cipher Converts the plain text into cipher text by taking 1 byte of plain text at a time.
2.	Block cipher uses either 64 bits or more than 64 bits.	While stream cipher uses 8 bits.
3.	The complexity of block cipher is simple.	        While stream cipher is more complex.
4.	Block cipher Uses confusion as well as diffusion.	While stream cipher uses only confusion.
5.	In block cipher, reverse encrypted text is hard.	While in-stream cipher, reverse encrypted text is easy.
